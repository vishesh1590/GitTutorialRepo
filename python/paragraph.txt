Sigma Years

Once I was sigma years old
My skibidi told me
Go make yourself some rizzlers 
or youll  be lonely
Once I was sigma years old

It was a big big gyatt,
But we thought ours were bigger 
Edging each other to the limits,
We were gooning quicker

Things We Talked About During Summer Band
We spent quite a bit of time during summer band discussing important topics for any band student to know
Directors presented several topics each day for the first 6 days
By no means must everyone read all of this, but it may be helpful as a reference, and you may find it interesting!
Dragon Band - Band Education Book


Class Plans
Each week the V and JV winds will have class plans set up in this document
Use the tabs across the bottom for any given week
Students can look here to find out what well be working on any given day
Things may change if the need arises to work on something else with the marching show but this will give you a good idea!


Region Listening Schedule
Each week the V winds and select JV winds will perform TMEA Region Etude selections for a director
The region etudes are divided into 4 parts, or cuts and 1 cut is performed each week
Region listenings generally happen on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays
Students can find the schedule here!


Off Periods
Students - You may not hang out in any of our areas during Off Periods as we cannot supervise you during these times
The main idea for an Off Period is that students be Off Campus

Rules for Off Periods from Campus Administration
Here are some general guidelines regarding off-campus periods if you do need to be on campus:
If you need to ride the bus, you must stay on campus.
You must be in the library unless the library is closed.  
If the library is closed, you may wait in the library foyer. 
Students (juniors & seniors) who have an off-campus period for 4th/8th period and D lunch are allowed to leave campus at the beginning of lunch on the day of their off-period.
You must enter the building once on campus (Report to the library).
Students are not allowed to hang out in the parking lot, in the 100 Student Center, or in open areas around campus.
All doors/gates are locked at 9:00 AM. Do not knock on locked doors to be let into the building.  You must walk around the building to the front of the 1200 building. 
If you arrive late because you have an off-period, you will need to walk to the front of the 1200 building to enter the campus.
Students are encouraged to work on assignments/study during their off-campus periods.  Quiet conversations are also acceptable.
If there is an emergency drill (lock-down, evacuation, etc.), you should follow the instructions of the librarian.
Failure to follow these guidelines could result in you losing your off period.


Private Lessons
We encourage all students to sign up for and take private lessons
Most of our masterclasses during summer band were taught by our own private lesson teachers, so students have some familiarity with these folks already
Students should sign up using this form IF they have not already done so
https://forms.gle/hSxtoruTZjsruNqJ6
The list of students will then be sent to the lesson teachers and theyll begin creating their schedules for the coming semester
The private lesson teacher will contact the student about their lesson time and lessons will begin in coming weeks


Grades
Students must remain academically eligible to participate in football games and marching contest performances and all TMEA activities. Should a student become ineligible they will still practice with the group during band class and in some cases, outside of the school day.
There are two types of official grade reporting - IPR (Interim Progress Report) and Report Card.  We are required to go by these official methods to determine eligibility.
Eligibility Calendar
The main thing to remember is  - ALL STUDENTS - PASS YOUR CLASSES TO REMAIN ELIGIBLE


Attendance
Look ahead at the rehearsal and event schedule and plan your appointments and tutorial help around it
The band's calendar is on dragonband.com
Attendance at rehearsals and events is mandatory unless otherwise specified
Absences due to sickness are excused with notification from a parent if the student has a fever, is vomiting or cannot otherwise get out of bed
